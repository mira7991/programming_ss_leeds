"""
 
In this code, 
1) We create and move agents around as in the previous practicals. 
2) However we make the objects, our agents, by using our template - Agent class - that is stored in the agentframework 
module and move the agents around using the class method '.move()'. The class has variables - randomly 
initialized x and y coordinates. Using classes helps to produce clean and easy to maintain code and is
useful to build complicated system.
