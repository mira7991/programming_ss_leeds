"""

This piece of code shrinks the practical 2 code by introducing control flow statement 'for'. We use it
to create as many agents as we want (num_of_agents), and move them as many times as we like(num_of_iterations). 
Also, in this practical, we show two solutions to address edge issues - the case when the agents move too far away.
First solution is solid wall setting - when the agent moves too far it's coord-s are reset to min boundary/max boundary.
Second solution is torus - if agents moves away at the top/right,  it enters from bottom/left and the opposite/
