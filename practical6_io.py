"""
In this code, 
1) we import raster data as our agents' environment;
2) let our created agents interact with it- move around it, eat and and store eaten from the environment -
 using the Agent class methods stored in agentframework(more details about the methods in agentframework.py)
3) we write out the changed environment to the file.
